        "In this assessment, we analyzed a cardiovascular health dataset to understand the relationship between various factors—demographic, clinical, and lifestyle—on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Using Python in Google Colab, we performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. We focused on key combinations of factors (e.g., age, cholesterol, smoking status) and examined how these relate to the likelihood of developing CVD. To support our analysis, we generated visualizations such as bar charts and scatter plots, revealing trends and insights into cardiovascular health. Additionally, we followed a structured process to ensure that the code was organized, efficient, and tested. The results from this analysis are intended to provide actionable recommendations for reducing CVD risk, as well as insights into patterns in cardiovascular health.\n"

        "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death globally, affecting millions of individuals each year. Given the complex interaction of demographic factors (such as age and gender), clinical factors (such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels), and lifestyle factors (such as smoking and physical activity), there is a pressing need to identify patterns that could help predict and prevent CVD. This assessment seeks to investigate the relationships between these variables and cardiovascular health outcomes, with a particular focus on determining which factor combinations are the most significant predictors of CVD. By understanding these relationships, we aim to support healthcare professionals and policymakers in developing targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence of CVD.\n",

        "2. Analyze different combinations of factors to determine which contribute most to CVD risk.\n",
        "3. Provide actionable insights that can inform public health strategies to prevent and manage CVD.\n",
        "4. Generate visualizations that clearly present the relationships between these factors and cardiovascular health, supporting the interpretation of the results."

To improve the clarity and interpretation of the data, we applied the following transformations:\n",
        "* Age: Converted from days to years, and then grouped into age categories (e.g., 20–29, 30–39, etc.) to allow for easier comparison across different age groups.\n",

As expected, older age groups (especially 50+) showed a higher prevalence. However, we also noticed that younger groups (particularly 30–39) exhibited a significant risk when other factors like high cholesterol or smoking were present.\n",
        "* Gender vs. Smoking Status: A bar chart was created to explore gender differences in smoking habits. Our analysis revealed that males tend to have higher smoking rates, which correlates with a slightly higher cardiovascular disease prevalence among men compared to women.\n",
        "* Cholesterol vs. Physical Activity by Gender: This visualization helped us\n",
        "explore the interaction between cholesterol levels, physical activity, and gender. It became clear that individuals with high cholesterol who were also physically inactive—especially males—had a substantially higher risk of cardiovascular disease.\n",

Interestingly, we also identified that younger individuals, particularly those in the 20–29 and 30–39 age groups, are not exempt from cardiovascular risks. This was especially true for those with additional risk factors such as high cholesterol or smoking habits.\n",
        "* Gender and Smoking: Our analysis highlighted that males tend to have higher\n",
        "smoking rates compared to females, which correlates with a slightly increased incidence of cardiovascular disease among males. This suggests that smoking is a significant factor in cardiovascular health disparities between genders.\n",
        "* Cholesterol, Physical Activity, and Gender: We observed that individuals with above-normal or well above-normal cholesterol levels who were also physically inactive showed a markedly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. This trend was particularly pronounced among males, further underscoring the interaction between lifestyle factors and health outcomes.\n",
        "* Correlation Analysis: The correlation heatmap revealed strong positive correlations between cardiovascular disease and factors such as cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and age.

Such models would allow us to assess the probability of disease occurrence based on a combination of variables.\n",

        "In conclusion, our analysis has provided valuable insights into the relationships between cardiovascular diseases and various risk factors, such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle behaviors like smoking and physical inactivity. While the study confirmed the expected trends, such as the heightened risk for older individuals and smokers, it also revealed less obvious patterns, particularly among younger age groups and the interaction between cholesterol levels and physical activity. These insights can serve as a foundation for designing targeted interventions to mitigate cardiovascular risks.\n",

        "However, the limitations of our analysis, including incomplete data and the lack of genetic and socioeconomic considerations, highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach in future research. By incorporating more diverse datasets and applying advanced modeling techniques, future analyses could yield even deeper insights, leading to more effective preventive strategies for cardiovascular health.\n",
